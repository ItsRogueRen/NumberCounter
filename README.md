# NumberCounter
A basic number counter for Linux Mac and Windows that exports to txt files for use with OBS Studio.

Code was commissioned and isn't pretty but works. I couldn't find anything for Linux that did this.

The program works by giving you a value and + and - buttons to change that value up or down. The counter can be named by clicking the text above it. That number is exported to a .txt file and updated every time the number changes. This allows you to have a text source in OBS Studio that can be updated on the fly for things like # of deaths in the game you're playing, how many collectables are left, etc. 

in the "File" menu you can add more counters and swap between Light and Dark themes.
